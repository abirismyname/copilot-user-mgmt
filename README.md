# Copilot User Management 
Regularly optimize cost and seat usage for an organization by removing unused Copilot for Business seat assignments from the Organization.

> **_If your organization has enabled Copilot access for all members, then the delete API will not work. Enable access for selected members in order to manage seats via the API. In this case, you can use the report to manually remove the seat assignments._**


> Note: **4-Mar-2024** This Action uses the Copilot for Business API, which is in public Beta and subject to change

## Usage in workflow

Incorporate the copilot-user-mgmt action into your workflow and initiate the workflow either manually or through a schedule. For a routine identification of inactive users and their removal from Copilot seat assignments, utilize the scheduled workflow. This workflow can be set to run on the 26th of each month, checking for users inactive for the last 25 days or those who have never used Copilot, and subsequently removing them. This approach allows sufficient time for seat assignment reversion if needed, and ensures the removal takes effect as part of the next billing cycle.

## Potential for extension
You can Fork and modify the Actions code to incorporate User management using Teams.

## Report
Copilot usage report is added as a build artifact in the workflow. You can download the report from the workflow run page.
