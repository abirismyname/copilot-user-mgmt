# Copilot User Management 
Regularly optimize cost and seat usage for an organization by removing unused Copilot for Business seat assignments from the Organization.

> If your organization has enabled Copilot access for all members, then the delete API will not work. Enable access for selected members in order to manage seats via the API. In this case, you can use the report to manually remove the seat assignments.


> Note: **4-Mar-2024** This Action uses the Copilot for Business API, which is in public Beta and subject to change
